# Pokemon Application Using React Js
This a React application. In the application, Pokemon are loaded and displayed, which are accessible via a public API. The application is **divided into two parts**. The first part is about the **fetching and the general presentation of the data**. The second part is about the **manipulation of the displayed data using a filter**.
<p>Genral Presentation of the data, and manipulation of the displayed data using a filter <span style="color:blue">.<em>blue</em> </span>.</p>
 The publicly available PokeAPI (https://pokeapi.co/) is used in this application.  This filter is limited to the displayed data based on the Pokemon type. Since Pokemon can have several types, it is possible to select several types at the same time in the filter. 
 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
